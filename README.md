I started work with PC since 12 years old. That time I am remembering very nice, I was obsessed about programming and learning something new with constancy, which continues to this day.

I know such technologies as:
- JavaScript
- C++
- Python
- Java

        class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++ ) {
            for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                
                if (i == j) continue;

                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    result[0] = i;
                    result[1] = j;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    }
